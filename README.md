# google-homepage

This is my first project in the github with the Project-Odin. I have started learning and i will be an excellent creator for computer apps, programs, wesites and webpages. I want to learn full stack development and then move to computer games development. Also, i am interested in teaching my skill to other people, if they are interested. 

Thanks,

Siddharth Pande
